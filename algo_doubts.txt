The Time complexity of both BFS and DFS will be O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices, and E is the number of Edges. 

if E >> V , the O(V+E) ~= O(E)
if V >> E , the O(V+E) ~= O(V)

O(V+E) tries to cover either of the above possibilities.

Applications of DFS:

* MST detection
* Detecting cycles
* Path Finding
* Topo Sort
* if Bipartite
* Strongly connected components
* Solving puzzles with only one solution

Applications of BFS:

* Shortest Path and Minimum Spanning Tree
* Peer to Peer Networks
* Crawlers in Search Engines
* Social Networking Websites
* GPS Navigation systems
* Broadcasting in Network
* Garbage Collection
* Ford-Fulkerson algorithm
* if Bipartite
